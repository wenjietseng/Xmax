# Xmax

I create a gif file for display a chistmas tree. The tree.R contains my source code.
I use ggplot to create the tree. The code is a little mess, since I do not have a
brilliant statistical simulation process to create one.
In the end of this file, I produce Weihnachtsbaum.gif with package animation.

<br>
The weihnachtsbaum.Rmd is the rmarkdown version of tree.R.
The output weihnachtsbaum.html is stored it in the repository.
<br>
Anyone wants to create one could use and modify my R code if you don't mind my rough version.
Hope everyone has a nice Xmas.
